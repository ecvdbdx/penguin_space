## Getting started

### Development

Watch css and run the app in development mode:
```
npm run start
```

Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

### Production

Build the app for production to the build folder:
```
npm run build
```

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
